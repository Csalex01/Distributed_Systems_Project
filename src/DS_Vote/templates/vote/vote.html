<!--
This HTML file represents the vote page template for a distributed systems project.
It extends the "base.html" template and contains a form for voting on the color of a dress.

The main content of the page is wrapped in a <main> element with the class "vote-main".
Inside the <main> element, there is an <img> element displaying an image of the dress.
The image source is set to "../../static/The_dress_blueblackwhitegold.jpg" and has an alt attribute.

The voting form is defined within a <form> element with the class "vote-form".
The form action is set to "/vote" and the method is set to "post".
The form contains a CSRF token for security purposes.

The form also includes a heading with the label of the voting field, which is dynamically generated using the form object.
The voting options are rendered using a for loop that iterates over the subfields of the voting field.
Each subfield is rendered as a radio button with a corresponding label.

Finally, the form includes a submit button generated by the form object.

Note: Some parts of the code are commented out, which indicates that they are currently not being used.
